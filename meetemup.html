              Meet-Em-Up was designed to bring people together in an ever
              changing world. Today, technology has been bringing people closer
              together than ever before. In the recent past, technology was seen
              as a hastle and just another stressful addition to life in
              general. Now with COVID-19 technology and human connection is even
              more important than it ever was. Meet-Em-Up brings the user closer
              to the way things used to be, but digitally. Search Meet-Em-Up for
              groups meeting in your area, whether that be online, or in an
              outdoor/social-distance setting. Get back to normal. Get out there
              and Meet-Em-Up!

              Tech Stack Explanation
            </h2>
            <p class="proj-desc-left">
              This project was another, where React was the perfect candidate to
              complete the task. Since React is so flexible with its components
              features it was an easy choice to make when picking a set of build
              tools. Reusable components made creating this progressive web app
              move a little more smoothly. Use of Meetup's powerful API and
              Amazon Web Services made programming serverless functions to
              authenticate user's a breeze, while providing users with a quick
              and easy way to login and get meeting people faster! Whats even
              better, is that the use of AWS and React allow users to download
              the application directly to their device, and use the application
              offline! In a tunnel on your way to your meetup without service?
              No problem! The meetups viewed last are saved locally, and since
              users can download the app to their device, they won't need a
              connection to get their app open and find their way to that
              meetup!

              The Process
            </h2>
            <p class="proj-desc-left">
              As with most of my projects the process starts out with some user
              stories. I like to try and get a feel for what a user might want
              out of an application. From there we move into some basic sketched
              wireframes where I layout some of the basic structures that I'd
              like to see on the screen. Where available, references to project
              assets are used to compare design templates, and getting more
              concrete design concepts locked in place. After code is
              implemented, a thorough testing phase is conducted, however with
              this particular project, testing was conducted throughout the
              project using TDD and BDD mindsets. All testing was conducted both
              before and after code was implemented, resulting in more than a
              90% test coverage rate!

              Lessons Learned
            </h2>
            <p class="proj-desc-left">
              I learned so much from this project in terms of coding best
              practices, and the importance of testing. This project was
              developed with both a TDD and BDD mindset. At first for a new
              coder, this task seemed quite daunting, however, the experience
              helped me grow as a developer, and as a person in general. The
              patience required to think ahead of the code you need to write is
              a skill worth developing, and well worth taking the time to
              continue to expand on.
