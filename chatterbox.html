              Tech Stack Explanation
            </h2>
            <p class="proj-desc-left">
              I chose to use React-Native to complete this project because it
              was the ideal tool to create a hand-held chat application that you
              could use on the go, and offline. I incorporated Expo into the
              project because of the access to its wide variety of built-in
              APIs. React-Navigation helps build the content of the pages, and
              Firestore is the backbone of the project, storing and sending user
              messages real-time.

              The Process
            </h2>
            <p class="proj-desc-left">
              Chatter-Box was built up with an emphasis on collaboration, and
              referencing project assets was of vital importance. The goal was
              to bring the "client" a product as close to their visual design as
              possible. Throughout the development process both wireframes and
              user stories drove the creation of this React-Native chat app.
              Thorough testing and a major focus on detailed documentation
              helped further increase the collaborative feel and goals of this
              project. As the setup for this project was quite detailed and
              complex, a highly detailed README.md was created along with
              documentation created with JSDocs.

              Lessons Learned
            </h2>
            <p class="proj-desc-left">
              This project was a long lesson in patience and determination.
              Initially I began this project thinking that it would be a very
              simple task to accomplish in a short period of time. Rushing is
              never a solution to any situation, no matter how dire. I learned
              that when you rush, you sacrifice quality, and quality will beat
              out quantity when it comes to user experience every day of the
              week. Learning how to navigate the seemingly daily changing world
              of React-Native was a task well worth taking on considering all
              the lessons learned.
